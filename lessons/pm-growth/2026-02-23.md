# Daily PM Lesson — February 23, 2026

**Category:** Team Leadership & People Management

## Hook

If you're doing the same job you were doing six months ago, you're not growing — you're blocking. The most counterintuitive sign of a great leader? They keep *giving away* the work they're best at.

## Concept: Give Away Your Legos

Molly Graham (ex-Google, ex-Facebook, COO of Quip) coined this metaphor after watching hundreds of high performers stall during hypergrowth. Here's the core idea:

When a team scales, everyone starts with a massive pile of Legos — they're doing 10 jobs, building everything. It feels great. Then new people join, and suddenly you feel a gut-level anxiety: *"Are they taking my job? What if they do it wrong? What if they're better than me?"*

Graham says this is **the single most predictable emotion in scaling organizations** — and the leaders who thrive are the ones who learn to hand over their Legos willingly, even eagerly.

At Facebook, she watched this pattern over and over: the people who held on too tightly to "their" work became bottlenecks. The ones who gave it away and moved to the next hard problem? They grew with the company.

**The key insight for senior PMs:** Your job at the Principal/Director level isn't to be the best individual contributor. It's to *constantly be giving away your current scope* so you can take on the next altitude of problems. If you're still writing PRDs for features you could delegate, you're playing with yesterday's Legos.

This is especially hard for engineer-turned-PMs, because the craft of detailed product work is what got you here. But what got you here won't get you there.

## Apply It

**Today's exercise:** List the top 5 things you spend time on each week. For each one, ask: *"Could someone on my team do 70% of this as well as I can?"* If yes, that's a Lego to give away. Pick one and start the handoff this week — write a brief doc, pair with the person, then step back.

At Walmart's scale, this might mean handing off a feature area to a Senior PM, or delegating a stakeholder relationship to a growing PM who needs that exposure.

## Mini Challenge

Think about a time you resisted giving something away — and it eventually became a bottleneck. What was the cost? Now think about something you're holding onto *right now* that fits the same pattern. Journal one paragraph about what's really stopping you from letting go. Is it quality concerns, or ego?
