# Daily PM Lesson — February 25, 2026

## Hook

Most PMs treat every task like it matters equally. They give 100% effort to a status update email *and* 100% to a critical strategy doc. What if the secret to operating at VP-level isn't doing more — it's deliberately doing some things *worse*?

## Concept: The LNO Framework

Shreyas Doshi (ex-Stripe, Twitter, Google PM leader) introduced the **LNO Framework** — a brutally simple way to categorize your work:

- **L (Leverage):** Tasks where exceptional effort produces 10x outsized returns. Think: your annual planning doc, a key exec review, hiring a critical leader, a pricing strategy decision. These deserve your absolute best work.
- **N (Neutral):** Tasks where good effort and great effort produce roughly the same outcome. Think: most recurring meetings, standard sprint reviews, routine stakeholder updates. Do these *well enough* and move on.
- **O (Overhead):** Tasks that just need to get done. Think: expense reports, filling out compliance forms, updating Jira tickets. Minimum viable effort. Automate or delegate where possible.

The insight isn't revolutionary — it's that **most senior PMs intellectually agree but behaviorally treat everything as L-tasks.** They're perfectionists who polish a weekly status email for 45 minutes instead of spending that time on the strategy memo that could reshape their product's direction.

Shreyas estimates that for a senior PM, roughly **10-20% of tasks are L, 60-70% are N, and 20% are O.** Yet most PMs allocate effort almost uniformly.

## Apply It

**Today's exercise:** Open your calendar and task list for this week. Label every item L, N, or O. Be honest — most things are N or O. Then ask yourself:

1. Am I spending disproportionate time on my L-tasks? Or am I spreading effort evenly?
2. Which N-tasks am I over-investing in? (At Walmart's scale, those recurring alignment meetings and status decks are probably N — good enough is good enough.)
3. What's one O-task I can automate, delegate, or batch into 15 minutes?

The goal: **free up 3-5 hours this week** by downgrading effort on N and O tasks, and reinvest that time into your highest-leverage work.

## Mini Challenge

Think about your last two weeks. Identify one task you spent significant time on that was actually an **N or O task** you treated as an L. What would you do differently? Write one sentence capturing the rule you'd set for yourself going forward.
