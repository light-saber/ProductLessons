# Daily PM Lesson — February 19, 2026

**Category:** Stakeholder & Exec Communication

## Hook

Here's a dirty secret about exec reviews: **the decision was already made before you walked in.** The meeting isn't where decisions happen — it's where decisions get *ratified*. If you're still "presenting" to execs, you're playing the wrong game.

## Concept: Pre-Wire or Die

The best senior PMs never surprise executives in a meeting. They **pre-wire** — socializing the key idea, getting feedback, and building alignment *before* the formal review. By the time the room convenes, the exec already knows the punchline and has had their objections addressed privately.

Lenny Rachitsky and Nels Gilbreth call this the **"W Framework"** from their planning experiences at Airbnb and Eventbrite. The core insight: most planning (and communication) disasters happen because of **unclear roles and mismatched timing** — who provides input, who decides, and *when* each happens. The "W" shape represents leadership setting context → teams proposing → leadership aligning → teams finalizing. At every zigzag, there's explicit back-and-forth. No one is blindsided.

**Why does this matter at your level?** Principal PMs often have the analytical horsepower to build great plans — but lose the room because they didn't invest in the hallway conversation. Shreyas Doshi frames it well: the difference between a PM and a *leader* is that the leader shapes the narrative before the narrative shapes them.

**Practical pre-wiring moves:**
- **1:1 before the meeting:** Share your recommendation with each key stakeholder individually. Ask: "What would make this a no for you?" Fix it before the room.
- **Send the read-ahead early.** Not 30 minutes before — 48 hours before. Execs skim. Give them time.
- **Lead with the decision, not the analysis.** Execs don't want your journey. They want: "Here's what I recommend, here's why, here's the risk."

## Apply It

Think about your next big review or planning meeting at Walmart. Before it happens:

1. List the 3 people whose buy-in matters most.
2. Schedule a 15-minute 1:1 with each *this week* — not to "present" but to **ask**: "What concerns would you have if we went this direction?"
3. Incorporate their input into your final doc. When they see their fingerprints in the proposal, they'll defend it as their own.

## Mini Challenge

**Self-assessment:** Think about your last 3 exec reviews. In how many did you pre-wire with *every* key decision-maker beforehand? If it's less than 3/3 — that's your gap. Journal about what held you back (time? access? discomfort?) and pick one specific action to close that gap this week.
