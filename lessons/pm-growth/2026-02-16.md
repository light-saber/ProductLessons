# Daily Lesson: February 16, 2026

## Hook
Your team missing deadlines? Before you blame execution, check if you actually decided *what* matters.

## Concept
Shreyas Doshi (Stripe, Twitter, Google) has a brutal insight: **80% of execution problems are strategy problems in disguise.**

When your Assortment Repository team is "slow," the real issue often isn't engineering velocity—it's unclear priorities, conflicting goals, or stakeholders who never agreed on the definition of done.

Principal PMs fix this by making the implicit explicit:
- What are we *not* doing this quarter?
- What does "good enough" look like?
- Who owns the final call?

Without these answers, your engineers are building on quicksand.

## Apply It
Think of one "execution issue" your team faced last week. Was it really resource constraints—or was the strategy unclear? Be honest.

## Action
Before your next standup, write down: *"The single most important outcome for Assortment Repository this month is ______."* Share it. See who disagrees. That's your real work.
