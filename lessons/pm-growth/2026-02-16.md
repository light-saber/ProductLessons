# Daily PM Lesson: February 16, 2026

## The Three Levels of Product Work

**Hook:**  
You're drowning in Jira tickets, roadmap debates, and stakeholder pings. But here's the uncomfortable truth: *Most execution problems are actually strategy problems in disguise.*

**Concept:**  
Shreyas Doshi (Stripe, Twitter, Google) describes three levels of PM work:

1. **Impact** — *Choosing the right problem*  
   This is the "why." The strategic bet. The thing that, if you nail it, changes the trajectory of your business. Principal PMs live here.

2. **Execution** — *Solving it well*  
   The "how." Building the right thing, shipping it, making it work. Most PMs spend 80% of their time here.

3. **Optimization** — *Solving it better*  
   The "what else." A/B tests, small tweaks, incremental gains. PMs often mistake this for impact.

**The trap:** When teams struggle with "execution," they rarely need better project management. They need clarity on Level 1. Tension in the room? Usually misalignment on which level you're operating at.

**Apply It:**  
Look at your Assortment Repository roadmap. Pick one active initiative. Ask honestly: *Are we debating Level 2 (how to build it) when we haven't locked Level 1 (why this matters for Walmart's pre-item universe)?*

**Action:**  
Before your next standup, write down the "Impact" sentence for your top 3 priorities. One line each: *"If we nail this, [business outcome] happens because [customer behavior changes]."*  

If you can't write it clearly — you're not at Level 1 yet. Thoda soch ke. 🎯
