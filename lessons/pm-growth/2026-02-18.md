# Daily PM Lesson — February 18, 2026

**Category:** Cross-functional Influence

---

## Hook

"Influence without authority" is the most overused phrase in PM job descriptions. But here's the uncomfortable truth: most PMs confuse *informing* people with *influencing* them. Sending a Slack message with your recommendation isn't influence. It's a notification.

## Concept: The Energy Audit

Chris Fralic (First Round Capital) built one of the best networks in tech by following a deceptively simple principle: **the energy you give people matters more than the information you share.**

Most PMs approach cross-functional work transactionally — "I need engineering to commit to this timeline," "I need design to prioritize my project." But the PMs who actually move organizations think differently. They ask: *Does this person walk away from our interaction with more energy or less?*

Fralic's framework breaks down into a few key behaviors:

1. **Convey genuine appreciation** — not flattery, but specific acknowledgment of someone's work or expertise. "Your API redesign made the checkout migration possible" hits different than "great job."

2. **Be the person who connects dots** — introduce people across orgs who should know each other. This compounds quietly over months.

3. **Give before you ask** — share context, flag risks early, offer help on their priorities. When you eventually need something, the relationship has a balance.

4. **End every meeting with energy, not just action items** — people remember how you made them feel long after they forget your slides.

Shreyas Doshi calls this the difference between "operating" and "leading." At the Principal/Director level, your output isn't features — it's the quality of decisions made across the org. And decisions flow through relationships.

## Apply It

**Today's exercise:** Pick three cross-functional partners you work with regularly at Walmart (an engineering lead, a design partner, a business stakeholder). For each one, honestly answer:

- When did I last give them something valuable *without asking for anything*?
- Do they leave our 1:1s with more clarity and energy, or less?
- Would they proactively flag a risk to me before I ask?

If any answer makes you wince — that's your signal. Send one of them a specific, genuine note of appreciation today. Not "thanks for your hard work." Something concrete they did that mattered.

## Mini Challenge

**Scenario:** You're pushing a new personalization initiative that needs ML engineering, merchandising buy-in, and legal review. ML eng is skeptical (they're overloaded), merchandising thinks it threatens their curation model, and legal hasn't responded to three emails.

Write down — in one sentence each — how you'd approach each stakeholder to *create energy* rather than just *request compliance*. No slides. No escalation. Just human connection.
