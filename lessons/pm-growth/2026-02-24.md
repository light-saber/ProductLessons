# Daily PM Lesson — February 24, 2026

**Category:** Customer Obsession

## Hook

You've heard of Amazon's "Working Backwards" press release. But there's a more powerful variant that almost nobody uses — and it's better at killing bad ideas before they consume a quarter of engineering time. It's called the **Customer Letter**.

## Concept

Amazon's internal press release is famous: before building anything, you write a fake press release announcing the finished product. It forces clarity on *why this matters*. But Marty Cagan (SVPG) describes a refinement developed at Nordstrom by former Amazonian Walker Lockhart: **the Customer Letter**.

Instead of a press release (which is still company-centric — "we launched X"), you write a letter **from a specific customer persona to the CEO**, explaining why they're thrilled about what you built.

The shift is subtle but powerful:

- A press release lets you hide behind features and corporate language.
- A customer letter forces you into **the customer's voice, their words, their emotions**. You have to articulate what changed *in their life*.

Here's why this matters at the Principal PM level: as you go senior, the risk isn't building the wrong feature — it's **framing the wrong problem**. A customer letter written before discovery exposes weak value propositions immediately. If the letter sounds generic or unconvincing, the initiative probably is too.

The best customer letters include:
1. **Who** the customer is (named persona, specific context)
2. **What problem** was so painful they noticed when it was solved
3. **How** their behavior changed — not feature descriptions, but *life changes*
4. **Why** they felt compelled to write about it

If you can't write a compelling 200-word letter, you don't understand the customer well enough to build for them.

## Apply It

Pick one initiative you're currently driving at Walmart. Write a customer letter — 200 words, from a specific shopper or associate persona, addressed to your VP or Doug McMillon. Describe why they're delighted. Read it back. Does it sound like something a real person would actually write? If it sounds like a PRD summary, rewrite it until it doesn't.

Share it with your engineering lead. Watch how much faster alignment happens compared to a roadmap slide.

## Mini Challenge

**The 2-letter test:** Write two customer letters for the same initiative — one from a customer who *loves* it, one from a customer it *fails*. The second letter often reveals the real risks your roadmap is ignoring.
