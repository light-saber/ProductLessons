# Daily PM Lesson — February 26, 2026

**Category:** Cross-functional Influence

---

## Hook

Here's a paradox: the more senior you get as a PM, the *less* direct authority you have over the things that matter most. Your biggest outcomes depend on engineering leaders, design directors, and business stakeholders who don't report to you and never will. So how do the best PMs get an entire organization to move in their direction — without a single direct report in the room?

## Concept: The Three Currencies of Influence

Shreyas Doshi frames PM work across three levels: **Impact, Execution, and Optics**. Most PMs obsess over the first two but neglect optics — not in a manipulative way, but as a *strategic communication layer* that creates energy, awareness, and momentum around your work.

The PMs who influence best don't just have good ideas. They trade in three currencies:

**1. Credibility (earned through pattern recognition)**
When you consistently diagnose problems accurately — "this execution issue is actually a strategy problem" — people start trusting your judgment. Chris Fralic (First Round Capital) calls this the compound interest of relationships: every time you're right *and* gracious about it, your influence account grows.

**2. Energy (projected through genuine curiosity)**
Fralic's 7 Rules for connection start with: *convey genuine appreciation* and *listen with intent*. In cross-functional settings, the PM who asks the sharpest follow-up questions — not the one who talks the most — becomes the person everyone wants in the room. Backchanneling ("tell me more about that constraint") signals that you value others' expertise.

**3. Foresight (demonstrated through pre-mortems)**
Doshi champions pre-mortems as an influence tool: before a launch, surface the "tigers" (catastrophic risks), "paper tigers" (overhyped fears), and "elephants" (things nobody's saying). The PM who names the elephant in the room earns disproportionate trust — because everyone was thinking it, but nobody was saying it.

The key insight: **influence isn't a personality trait. It's a practice.** You build it one interaction at a time — by being the person who makes the room smarter, not the person who makes the room aware of how smart *they* are.

## Apply It

Pick one cross-functional meeting today. Before it starts, write down:
- One risk nobody has named yet (the "elephant")
- One question you genuinely want to learn the answer to

In the meeting, surface the elephant clearly ("I want to flag something I think we're all sensing but haven't discussed...") and ask your curiosity question. Notice how the energy shifts.

## Mini Challenge

**Self-assessment:** Think of the last 3 decisions you influenced successfully at Walmart. For each one, which currency did you spend the most — Credibility, Energy, or Foresight? Which one do you underinvest in? Journal one sentence about how to rebalance.
