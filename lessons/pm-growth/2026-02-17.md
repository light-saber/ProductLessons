# Daily PM Lesson — February 17, 2026

## Hook
Principal PMs don't ship features. They ship clarity. But where does clarity come from? Not from better roadmaps—from better thinking *before* the roadmap.

## Concept: The Pre-Mortem
Shreyas Doshi (Stripe, Twitter, Google) swears by a dead-simple ritual: before committing to a bet, gather your team and ask *"It's 6 months from now. This failed. Why?"*

Not "what could go wrong?" — that's too abstract. Instead, imagine the failure already happened. The psychology shift is massive. People who stayed quiet in planning suddenly have specific, visceral insights. The engineer who didn't speak up mentions the integration risk. The designer points out the user segment nobody validated.

Most execution problems are actually strategy problems that nobody named early enough.

## Apply It
You're building the Assortment Repository at Walmart—a massive data system touching suppliers, buyers, and internal tools. Pick your current biggest initiative. Run a 20-minute pre-mortem this week:

1. *"It's December 2026. This initiative is considered a miss. What happened?"*
2. Force specificity: not "stakeholders didn't align" but *"the merchandising team never adopted it because X"*
3. For each reason, ask: *"What would we need to do differently starting now to prevent this?"*

## Action
Schedule that pre-mortem before your next roadmap review. Don't wait for the perfect time—pre-mortems work best when you still have optionality.
