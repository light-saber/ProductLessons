# Daily PM Lesson — February 20, 2026

**Category:** Data-Driven Decision Making

## 🎯 Hook

What if your dashboards are making you *worse* at your job? The most dangerous PMs aren't the ones who ignore data — they're the ones who hide behind it. At Director+ level, the game shifts from "what does the data say?" to "what does the data *not* say?"

## 💡 Concept: Data-Informed > Data-Driven

Shreyas Doshi draws a sharp line between being **data-driven** and **data-informed**. Data-driven means you let metrics dictate decisions. Data-informed means you *use* data as one powerful input alongside judgment, customer intuition, and strategic context.

Why does this matter at your level? Because the most consequential PM decisions — entering a new market, killing a beloved feature, reorganizing a platform — rarely have clean data to back them up *before* you make the call. The data only confirms (or refutes) *after*.

**Example:** When Brian Chesky decided Airbnb should pivot from "growth at all costs" to curated, quality-controlled stays, the existing metrics screamed against it. Listings growth, GMV, host acquisition — all pointed toward continuing the playbook. But qualitative signal (trust erosion, guest complaints, regulatory pressure) told a different story. The data was *right* about the past. His judgment was right about the future.

**The trap at big companies like Walmart:** In large orgs, data becomes a *political shield*. People cherry-pick metrics to justify pre-decided conclusions. "The data says..." becomes a way to avoid accountability for a judgment call. Senior PMs who always need a dashboard before moving are actually *under-performing* — they're outsourcing their thinking to a spreadsheet.

## 🔨 Apply It

**Today's exercise:** Pick one decision you're currently deliberating on. Write down:

1. What the data says (metrics, A/B tests, user analytics)
2. What the data *can't* tell you (strategic shifts, competitive moves, customer emotions, 2-year trajectory)
3. What your gut says — and *why* (trace it to experience, pattern-matching, or customer conversations)

If columns 2 and 3 are empty, you're being data-driven. If all three are filled, you're data-informed. A Principal PM's superpower is articulating the *reasoning behind the judgment*, not just the numbers.

## 🧩 Mini Challenge

**Scenario:** Your VP asks you to justify a major investment in a new fulfillment capability. Your quantitative analysis shows a modest 8% efficiency gain — not enough to clear the investment bar. But you've spoken to 15 store managers who all describe the same pain point, and you believe this capability is table-stakes in 18 months.

What do you present? How do you frame "I believe" alongside "the data shows"? Journal 3-4 bullet points on how you'd structure that conversation.
